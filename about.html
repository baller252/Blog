    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;My first console was a will and it had some of my favorite childhood games like Mario super sluggers, Wii sports/ sports resort, Wii party, etc. I first played on the Wii when I was 5 and that is was sparked my interest in video games. Those games are very nostalgic and they should have a remake of all of them. I know they have a remake of will sports called Nintendo switch sports but it's not that good. </p>
  
<p class="text_column">&nbsp;My second console was an Xbox 360 and some of the games I played on there were NCAA 14, Kinect adventures, and call of duty black ops 2. I played those games when I was 8 those games were good 1. because black ops 2 was my first shooting game and it was fun, 2. Kinect adventures was my first party game, and 3. NCAA 14 is football so that why I played it.

    <p class="text_column">&nbsp;The console I have currently is the Xbox one and it has been very reliable. I play madden 23, NBA 2k 23, call of duty Warzone, and fall guys. I like my Xbox but think it's time for an upgrade. Xbox can get boring sometimes because it is the same boring repetitive games time and time again. </p>
