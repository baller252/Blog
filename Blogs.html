<p class="text_column">The article talks about caps gaming hosting a tournament for a cash prize of $15,000. It would be 32-team, six-versus-six competition on Xbox One. Starting with an eight-week regular season, the event will see 16 teams proceed on to a single-elimination tournament. I like the article because I like competition, winning, and money.

I states that the Global Championship will take place in Denmark late in 2023, and will feature the 75 best Fortnite duos of the season. The 40 best-ranked duos will advance to the Major grand finals and will battle it out for a grande prize of $10 million. I like the article because I like the sound of winning all that money. I think it conveys the message very well. I think the article goes in depth enough. What’s interesting about the article is that it shows the differential of the prize money from the world cup in 2019. &nbsp;<a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/01/fortnite-esports-2023-majors">article 2 </a> </p>
